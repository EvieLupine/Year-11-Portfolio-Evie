 <h1> ☆Development</h1>

  <h2>☆Character Turnaround</h2>  
 </div>
 <p>I have made a threepoint turnaround of my character for my game.
    It is original and has a feel good aesthetic. It includes a head, torso, legs and a tail.
     It the first design and will need future improvements.</p>

 <h2>☆Testing</h2>
</p> Peronally I think this character could have been made simpler so that the task of
 moddelling and rigging it is made alot easier to follow. To make it better follow my requirements there will need to be an element of disablity awareness in the character since it is part of my idea for the game.</p> 
<h2> ☆Feedback</h2>
<p> Q: Do you think this is appealing to an audience of the age 9-14?</p>
<p> A: Yes because it is very cute and will probably attract kids attention with it's chibi-like design.</p>
<p> A: Yes I defintely think so because it has a nice dress.</p>
<p> Q: Is there anything you would change in the character's design to make it more appealing to a female audience?</p> 
<p> A: No I wouldn't change anything because it is great the way it is.</p>
<p> A: No the desidn itself is appealing to most female audiences I'd assume. </p>
<h2> ☆Improvements</h2>
<p> To think that I was considering a lot of changes that needed to be done was almost wrong, 
    my feedback is suggesting that I don't need to and it is really good the way it is. So I have decided to keep it
     the way it is. I think furthermore into the future I will make more subtle changes when moddelling so it
      doesn't look as messy as the sketch is.</p>
