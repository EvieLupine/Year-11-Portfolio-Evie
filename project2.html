    <h1>Project 2</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> My team is making a Text Adventure about surviving a fictional pandemic and the goal is to find cure for the virus to heal yourself.
            In the beginning you start as slightly infected and you have a limited amount of turns to find the cure before the virus takes over.
            The cure is in random location and guarded by the government, the inspiration of the virus is the COVID-19 pandemic.
            To find the cure you have to uncover a special area where the cure is guarenteed to be but a big bad guy guards it. In this area you are not likely to survive so you haveto be smart about your next move.
           In addition you also have to find things to defend yourself against threats, its self defense so its ethical in order to get the cure and survive, otherwise you die from getting sick.

            <li>Middle.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li> An ending for the text adventure to work with turns and options to aquire an ending of choice.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
        </ul>
        <h3>Different endings</h3> <!-- Write another requirement here -->
        <ul>
            <li>An ending that results in death.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li>A cure is found.</li> <!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li>They ran out of turns.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
        </ul>
        <h3>An achievable goal </h3> <!-- Write another requirement here -->

            <li>Player finds the cure.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li> They survive.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li>They don't survive and that results with them getting the virus without the cure or even with.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
        </ul>
        <h3> Orginisation </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> The code is readable. </li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li> It is easy to maintain.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->
            <li>The code has scability.</li><!-- Write a specification to above requirement here -->

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <h4>The code needs to be functional. </h4> <!-- Write what the implication is here -->
        <p>For the code to be functional we as a team are going to check the code for problems,
            follow any given instructions, debug and update the code.</p> 
            <h4>The code needs to be usable. </h4><!-- Write what you'll do to address the implication here -->
        <!-- Copy and paste the above implication to add another implication -->
        <p> For it to be usable we need to get outside opinions about our game and conduct some usability testing. </p>
        <h4>For our work to be orginal and our own Intellectual Property</h4>
        <p>To enforce this, we will not be going onto Github to copy and paste snippets of code to claim it as our own. </p>
        <p> Also we will NOT be using ChatGpt to do the heavy lifting!! </p>
