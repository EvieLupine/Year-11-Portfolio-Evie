    <h3> ☆Project 3☆</h3>
    <h1>Low Poly Character</h1>
    <h2>Overview---→</h2>
    <p> I will make a low-poly character, to start with.
         That has an idle and running animation to present the way it will act.
         I want to make a character that is lupine because like most things in my work it has an element
          of wolf-ness that is unique to me and the public.</p>

    <h2> End Users</h2>
    <p> My target audience are children from ages of 9-14 who are wanting to play a game with a simple and nostalgic feel-good to it.
         This means the game must be innocent, cute and fun to play.
          The contents of the game must be in English since it is the language I speak and live in New Zealand where the game is created in. To make it enganging the characters will have bubbly and pretty animations to continue focus. Mostly girls will be the appeal to the game and characters. There will be a blend of cute/cool.</p>
    <h2> Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The character must have four limbs and a face of such to identify it as if it is an animal.</li> 
        <li>The character must be able to make flexible and fluid movements to make it unique and playable.</li> 
        <li>The character is of either male, female or a non affirming gender to create diversity.</li>
        <li>The character will have themes that raise awareness for disabilities.</li>
        <li>The character is appropriate for children and brings no concerning themes.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2> <u>Implications</u> </h2>

    <h2> Aesthetics</h2>
    <p> An aesthetic is a conception of beauty or art. This is important and relevant because it needs to look
         good and feel good. </p>
    <p>To create a good aesthetic I'll do this by sticking to a theme of lupine and cute but cool as I'll name it.</p>
    <h2> Functionality</h2>
    <p> This is functional because a theme based on an animal and how it looks can be used in many creative styles
         and colours. It also needs to function as a playable and moveable character that comes with animations and
          expressions. It also MUST be able to move quickly.</p>
          <p>To make sure the character is functional I will have to test its movement and make sure the legs move 
            smoothly so the run cycle feels good. It will also move based off of the personality of the character and 
            if it is male or female. In addition it basically needs to able to move around a world and stay relevant
             to its environment, I'll make sure of this by experimenting colour pallets and sticking to the lupine theme.</p>
    <h2> Usability</h2>
    <p> A game where you play as an animal is simple because to move around it only requires needing the ability to move
         up, down, left, right and speak. Without those features the game is not very usable or fun. </p>
         <p>It will be easy to use because it will have the basic moving keys like W,A,S and D. And it will be kept 
            updated so it does not have any bugs, I will do this by checking my code every so often when creating the 
            game and characters.</p>
    <h2> Specifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Proportionate to a wolf if making a wolf character but has cartoony features that make it more stylised and cute.</li>
       <li>Fluffy.</li>
        <li> Diverse colour pallete.</li>
       <li>Bold torso shape.</li>
       <li>Rigged.</li>
       <li>Moving tail and ears for added expression.</li>
       <li>Face.</li>
       <li>Legs are slim and strong.</li>
       <li>Cute and cool theme.</li>
       <li>Approprite for children.</li>
       <li>It needs to look like a wolf in order to even call it a wolf.</li>
       <li>Small sized.</li>
       <li>Patterns and pretty symbols as markings.</li>
       <li>Teeth.</li>
       <li> Accessories if possible.</li>
       <li> Paws and toes.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Intillectual Property</h2>
    <p>My character is my intillectual property because it will be something I have designed 
        and related to my aesthetic of choice.</p>
        <p>I will make sure it is an original idea by spending some time making design ideas and making sure it
             does not look like any other design of a wolf character. 
            Mine will be unique because of patterns and style I have modelled my low-poly character. </p>
