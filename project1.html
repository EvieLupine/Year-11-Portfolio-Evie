    <h1> Final Outcome</h1>

    <p> Text and information. HTML and CSS</p>
    <img> <h4><a href="Link Will Be Here">View My Project</a></h4>
    <h2> End Users</h2>
    <p> My main target is that I want to aim for Employers who work in the field of digital art and Digital Technology and perhaps employers who are employing people with coding experience. I hope to have created an outcome of something creative with an effective structure, usability and display of something unique to me. Any user might want something they can relate in a way that it looks vaguely familiar, however it is something unique and of my style so it is exciting to look at. But what they might need is something easy and structured to follow and understand.</p>
    <h2> Requirements</h2>
    <h2> Implications </h2>
    <h2> Aesthetics</h2>
    <p> Setting a variety of colours to create an ongoing theme that relates to a feel good Aesthetic.</p>
    <h2> Functionality</h2>
    <p> Adding links to work and things that are easy to navigate.</p>
    <h2> Usability</h2>
    <p> Making the text and font accessible to people who have trouble reading and seeing. And links to social medias containing my artwork.</p>
