<h2>Task 2: Head</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>This is the development progress of the head for my low-poly character.
 I created this by adding a cube as a starting point for making my head and 
used tools to further extend, shape and warm the 3D shape until it resembled a head. </p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Once I warped the 3D shape till it resembled the 
front and side view of the head, I started editing and testing how it looked
 at other angles untill eventually the head was just how I wanted.
 Additionally I created more detail to the muzzle, teeth and back of the head. </p>
